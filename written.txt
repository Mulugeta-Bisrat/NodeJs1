Q1. Why do we sometimes want to use SetImmediate instead of SetTimeOut
  
   SetTimeout registers a function in the timer phase of an event loop thus it can run before I/O event callbacks.
   SetImmediate registers a function in the check phase of the event loop which happens after I/O event callbacks.
   Thus when we want I/O callbacks to be processed before our function we use SetImmediate.

Q2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate.

    process.nextTick adds the call back to the nextTick queue which is not part of the event loop.
    Callbacks in the nextTick queue are processed before any callback in the event queue (timers or I/O callbacks).
    SetImmediate adds the callback in the check phase of the event loop which is processed after timers or I/O callbacks.
